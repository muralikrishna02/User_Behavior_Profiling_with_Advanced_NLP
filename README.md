# User_Behavior_Profiling_with_Advanced_NLP
This project explores user behavior on social media using Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.The primary objective is to leverage Large Language Models (LLM) to gain deep insights into user interactions, sentiments, and preferences.

## Key Features
- **NLP Techniques:** Harnesses state-of-the-art NLP techniques, with a focus on Large Language Models, to perform advanced analysis of user-generated content on social media platforms.
- **User Behavior Profiling:** Explores and profiles user behavior by analyzing patterns, sentiments, and engagement metrics within the dataset.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Utilizes NLP tools, including spaCy, for Named Entity Recognition to identify entities and enhance the understanding of user discussions.
- **Behavioral Insights:** Provides actionable insights derived from behavioral patterns observed in user-generated text, contributing to strategic decision-making.

## Large Language Models (LLM) Techniques
This project heavily relies on cutting-edge Large Language Models for various aspects of analysis, including:
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Employs LLM for sentiment analysis, deciphering the emotional tone within user-generated content.
- **Keyword Extraction:** Leverages LLM capabilities for extracting relevant keywords, facilitating a deeper understanding of user interests.
- **Advertisement Targeting:** Develops targeted advertising queries using LLM to identify users likely to engage with specific brand advertisements.

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- seaborn
- spaCy (for NLP and Named Entity Recognition)
- Hugging Face library (for Large Language Models)

## Achievements
- Successful implementation of LLM techniques for sentiment analysis and keyword extraction.
- Profound insights into user behavior derived from the application of NLP on social media data.
- Enhanced Named Entity Recognition for improved understanding of entities within user-generated content.
- Development of targeted advertising strategies using LLM-driven queries.

## Example Result
The outcomes of this project provide a nuanced understanding of user behavior, allowing for strategic decision-making in various domains, including social media engagement and targeted advertising.
